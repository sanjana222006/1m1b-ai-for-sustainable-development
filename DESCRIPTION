AI-Based Sustainable Waste Management Assistant is a conceptual AI project developed under the 1M1B AI + Sustainability Virtual Internship (IBM SkillsBuild & AICTE). The system uses conversational AI, prompt engineering, and retrieval-based logic to guide users on proper waste segregation and disposal. It aligns with UN SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and promotes environmentally responsible behavior through real-time AI-driven recommendations.
